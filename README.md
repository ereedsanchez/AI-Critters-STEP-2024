# AI-Critters : STEP Summer 2024

Learn about AI computer vision through building cameras and detecting animals on the Bronx Community College Campus!

#### Resources
- [ai-4-all.org](https://ai-4-all.org/resources/)
- [AI Image Training - Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image)

### Week 1 : Introduction to Computer Terminals, AI and Image Classification
- Learning Goals and Industry Context: Students will be able to code a visual program using P5 javascript.  They will incorporate machine learning into their P5 javascript projects, using Teachable Machine. 
- Implementation: 1.0.1 - 1.3.2
- Final Outcome or Product: Create an AI model with Teachable Machine of students face and run it on AI Object Detection model in P5Javascript, where it will discplay a coded self portrait.
