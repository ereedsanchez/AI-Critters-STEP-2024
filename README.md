# AI-Critters : STEP Summer 2024

Learn about AI computer vision through building cameras and detecting animals on the Bronx Community College Campus!

#### Resources
- [ai-4-all.org](https://ai-4-all.org/resources/)
- [AI Image Training - Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image)

### Week 1 : Introduction to Computer Terminals, AI and Image Classification
- Learning Goals and Industry Context: Students will be able to code a visual program using P5 javascript.  They will incorporate machine learning into their P5 javascript projects, using Teachable Machine. 
- Implementation: 1.0.1 - 1.3.2
- Final Outcome or Product: Create an AI model with Teachable Machine of students face and run it on AI Object Detection model in P5Javascript, where it will display a coded self portrait. 

##### <ins>1.0.1 : Monday Morning</ins>
Introduction to CMD (the windows terminal)
Learn how to talk and navigate computer systems like a pro (hacker!).

##### <ins>1.0.2: Monday Afternoon</ins>
Terminal / BASH, open source projects 

- LECTURE: What is Bash?
- LECTURE: What is Github?

- Workshop : Terminal Basics : [Cheat Sheet 1](https://github.com/yuanqing/shell-basics) , 
- Workshop : Understanding SSH : Video : [Log into the mainframe!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcywf9mwF5U) 
- Over the Wire Workshop (Abdon): 

##### <ins>1.1.1 : Tuesday Morning | Afternoon </ins>
Students will be presented with potential classes available in the summer.
 Students will provide a ranked vote of the classes they would like to participate in.  

##### <ins>1.2.1 : Wednesday Morning</ins>
Introduction to P5js. Students will learn the basics of P5js, including how to make shapes.  Their task will be to complete a self portrait using basics shapes.

##### <ins>1.2.2 : Wednesday Afternoon</ins>
Students will complete their Self portraits. 
Hour of Code Lesson: Self Portrait: https://www.code-art.com/hour-of-code-self-portrait/

##### <ins>1.3.1 : Thursday Morning</ins>
Students will use Teachable machine and make a AI Computer vision model of their faces.  They will spend time perfecting the model. 
Teachable Machine: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image

##### <ins>1.3.2: Thursday Afternoon</ins>
Students combined Self Portraits with AI computer vision models.  
The project is based on: https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/teachable-machine

### WEEK 2: Introduction to AI, Computer Vision and building DIY Cameras


###### Learning Goals and Industry Context: 
- Students will be able understand how to AI computer vision concepts and create a DIY Camera using WyzeCam or ESP32
- Students will leave knowing
- Machines make decisions based on data provided to them
- That data contains the bias of the people who entered it
- Considering this bias allows you to think about how to counteract it

###### Implementation: 2.0.1 - 2.3.2
- Final Outcome or Product: Create an AI model with Teachable Machine of students face and run it on AI Object Detection model in P5Javascript, where it will display a coded self portrait.

##### <ins>2.0.1 : Monday </ins>
- Build an AI computer from computer parts. 
- Prototype an outdoor housing box for WyzeCam. 
- Complete self portrait - combined sketch. 
- Complete Teachable Machine Model

##### <ins>2.1.1 : Tuesday Morning</ins>
- AI can be used in diverse fields including art and creativity
Students learn these things by exploring drawing in Google Quick, Draw!
