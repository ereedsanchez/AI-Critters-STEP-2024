##### <ins>1.1.2 : Tuesday Afternoon</ins>
AI & Drawing
This Byte of AI is meant to be a quick and fun way to begin to become familiar with some core ideas of modern AI including:
- How data becomes output in an AI model
- How human biases enter datasets
- AI can be used in diverse fields including art and creativity
Students learn these things by exploring drawing in Google Quick, Draw!
